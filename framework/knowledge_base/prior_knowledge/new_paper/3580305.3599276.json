    "paper_name": "CLUR: Uncertainty Estimation for Few-Shot Text Classification with Contrastive Learning",
    "method_name": "Contrastive Learning from Uncertainty Relations (CLUR)",
    "method_summary": "CLUR is a novel approach designed to enhance uncertainty estimation in few-shot text classification tasks. It addresses the limitations of traditional uncertainty estimation models which typically require a larger number of training samples. CLUR employs ensemble and pseudo-labeling techniques, allowing it to be trained with only one support sample for each class during each episode. Unlike existing methods that require manually set pseudo-uncertainty scores, CLUR dynamically learns these scores using uncertainty relations derived from data augmentation. It explores various model structures and contrastive learning components, ultimately aiming to optimize the model's performance.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments demonstrate that CLUR significantly outperforms six baseline models across multiple datasets. It effectively improves the accuracy of uncertainty scores in scenarios with few samples, achieving notable advancements in area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The analysis validates the effectiveness of CLUR's design choices, particularly in using contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of uncertainty estimation."
