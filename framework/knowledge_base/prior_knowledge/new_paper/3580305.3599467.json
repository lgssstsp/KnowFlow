    "paper_name": "Planning to Fairly Allocate: Probabilistic Fairness in the Restless Bandit Setting",
    "method_name": "ProbFair",
    "method_summary": "ProbFair is introduced as a probabilistically fair policy for resource allocation in the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) setting. It aims to maximize total expected reward while satisfying a budget constraint and ensuring a strictly positive lower bound on the probability of each arm being selected at each timestep. The method maps each arm to a stationary probability distribution over actions based on its transition matrix. It uses a dependent rounding algorithm to sample from this distribution, translating the continuous allocation policy into a discrete action vector that meets budgetary requirements. ProbFair enhances distributive fairness by incorporating fairness constraints in the decision-making process.",
    "experiment_summary": "The empirical evaluation of ProbFair demonstrates its effectiveness in enforcing the proposed probabilistic fairness constraint while minimizing the loss in expected reward. Various experiments showcase its competitive performance compared to other fairness-aware alternatives across different patient populations and transition settings. The findings indicate that ProbFair adjusts well to varying cohort compositions, maintaining stability in performance metrics related to intervention benefit and fairness."
