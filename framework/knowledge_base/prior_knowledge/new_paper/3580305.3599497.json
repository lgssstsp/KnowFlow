    "method_name": "SGIR (Semi-supervised Graph Imbalanced Regression)",
    "method_summary": "SGIR is a novel semi-supervised framework designed to tackle the challenges of imbalanced regression tasks specifically in graph property prediction. It employs a self-training approach that enhances the balance of training data over multiple iterations. The strategy includes pseudo-labeling high-confidence predictions for less represented label ranges, utilizing regression confidence for selecting quality pseudo-labels, and implementing reversesampling to address label imbalance. Additionally, SGIR incorporates a label-anchored mixup for augmenting graph examples in latent space, which helps create a better distribution of training examples across all label ranges, especially for under-represented areas.",
    "experiment_summary": "The empirical study involved experiments on several graph regression tasks. SGIR demonstrated significant performance improvements across different label ranges when compared to various baseline methods. Specifically, it reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) in both well-represented and under-represented label ranges, confirming the framework's effectiveness. The results indicate that SGIR not only enhances overall regression performance but also particularly benefits scenarios with few training samples."
