    "method_name": "GG-ODE (Generalized Graph Ordinary Differential Equations)",
    "method_summary": "GG-ODE is a machine learning framework designed for learning the continuous dynamics of multi-agent systems across various environments. It models dynamic interactions among agents through a shared ordinary differential equation (ODE) function parameterized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), capturing the common physics laws governing the dynamics. In addition, each environment is characterized by distinct latent exogenous factors embedded within the ODE, enabling the model to differentiate between environments. To enhance the learning process, two regularization losses are introduced: one to enforce orthogonality between the learned initial states and the exogenous factors using mutual information minimization, and the other to reduce the variance of these factors عبر contrastive learning.",
    "experiment_summary": "Extensive experiments were conducted across different physical systems to validate the effectiveness of GG-ODE. The results show that GG-ODE outperforms traditional discrete models, especially in long-range predictions, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities even in scenarios with limited observations from unseen systems. The experiments used datasets that simulated various multi-agent dynamics, with a focus on the model's accuracy in predicting future trajectories of agents under different environmental conditions."
