    "paper_name": "Preemptive Detection of Fake Accounts on Social Networks via Multi-Class Preferential Attachment Classifiers",
    "method_name": "Preferential Attachment k-class Classifier (PreAttacK)",
    "method_summary": "PreAttacK is an algorithm designed for the early detection of fake accounts on social networks, distinguishing itself from previous methods that rely on identifying connections or content shared by the accounts. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the behavior of new accounts regarding their initial friend requests made after registration. The algorithm utilizes a multi-class extension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model, termed k-Class Directed Preferential Attachment (kCDPA), to derive probabilistic assessments of whether a new account is fake or real based on the requests they send and receive. The key innovation is the derivation of provable performance guarantees to classify accounts based on minimal initial interactions, enabling detection before conventional methods come into play.",
    "experiment_summary": "The empirical evaluation demonstrates that PreAttacK converges to informative classifications with a high AUC (Area Under the Curve) of approximately 0.9 after new accounts have only sent and received a total of 20 friend requests, significantly outperforming existing algorithms that require more substantial interaction data. This allows for the timely identification of fake accounts before they can establish friendships with real users. The results indicate that PreAttacK effectively addresses the early detection paradox, achieving practical application on the global Facebook network."
