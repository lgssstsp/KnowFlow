    "paper_name": "Debiasing the Cloze Task in Sequential Recommendation with Bidirectional Transformers",
    "method_name": "Inverse Temporal Propensity Scoring (ITPS)",
    "method_summary": "The paper proposes a novel debiasing framework, named Inverse Temporal Propensity Scoring (ITPS), specifically crafted for sequential recommendations. ITPS aims to address the limitations of traditional Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) in handling sequential data by incorporating the temporal component of user interactions. The ITPS framework utilizes a specially designed loss function that captures the true relevance of items within the sequential context, allowing the model to provide unbiased estimates of item relevance by considering the dynamic exposure propensities of items over time. Additionally, the method integrates a bidirectional transformer model architecture (BERT4Rec) optimized for the Cloze task, facilitating improved prediction of user interactions.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments conducted in the paper validate the theoretical claims of the ITPS estimator's capability to mitigate exposure bias and effectively capture the true relevance of items. Through various datasets, the authors demonstrate the robustness of the ITPS approach against increasing levels of exposure bias. Experiments involve both semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, allowing the researchers to evaluate the impact of the ITPS framework on ranking accuracy and the effectiveness of debiasing in sequential recommendation settings. The results highlight that the ITPS method outperforms existing methods, including the naive BERT4Rec and IPS-BERT4Rec, confirming its superior performance in capturing user relevance over time."
