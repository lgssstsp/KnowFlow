    "method_name": "Sparse Oblique Decision Trees",
    "method_summary": "This paper presents a novel approach to interpretable clustering by constraining the cluster assignments to be derived from sparse oblique decision trees. This method enhances interpretability by allowing a clear understanding of how input features influence cluster assignments while maintaining a hierarchical structure in the clusters. The proposed joint learning framework optimizes both the clustering objective and the decision tree parameters simultaneously, resulting in an effective mapping for out-of-sample predictions. The use of oblique trees as opposed to traditional axis-aligned trees allows for better modeling of the underlying data distribution, particularly in high-dimensional settings.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, when applied to two variants of k-means, yields more optimal trees compared to traditional fitting methods. It shows that sparse oblique trees successfully maintain interpretability while achieving significant clustering quality, indicated by favorable results across various datasets. Additionally, the experiments illustrate the effectiveness of joint optimization in improving clustering outcomes while controlling the complexity of the resulting tree structures."
