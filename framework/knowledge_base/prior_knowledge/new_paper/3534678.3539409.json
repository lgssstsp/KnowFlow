    "method_name": "Hierarchically Separated Trees (HST)",
    "method_summary": "The paper proposes a differentially private algorithm for the k-median and k-means clustering problems. The method leverages tree embeddings, specifically using a random-shifted quadtree (Hierarchically Separated Tree), to efficiently compute clustering solutions while maintaining a privacy guarantee. The algorithm is designed to compute solutions with a cost at most O(d^3/2 log n) · OPT + O(k d^2 log^2 n / epsilon^2), allowing for scalability to large datasets with a running time of O˜(n k d). It emphasizes parallelization, enabling implementation in logarithmic rounds in massively parallel computing environments, addressing the gap between theoretical optimal algorithms and practical implementations.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experimental part of the paper demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm by comparing its performance against other state-of-the-art private clustering baselines in medium-sized datasets, as well as showcasing its scalability to large datasets where previous differentially private clustering methods had limitations. The results indicate that the proposed approach not only matches but often outperforms existing algorithms, achieving high quality clustering results across a variety of examples."
