    "method_name": "SRC (Selection, Reduction, Connection)",
    "method_summary": "The authors propose a formal characterization of graph pooling operators based on three main operations: Selection, Reduction, and Connection (SRC). The selection function groups nodes into subsets called supernodes, the reduction function aggregates each supernode to form an output node and its attributes, and the connection function links the reduced nodes. This framework allows for a unified representation of various existing pooling operators and serves as a foundation for further study and development in graph neural networks (GNNs). A comprehensive taxonomy of pooling methods is also introduced, categorizing them based on properties of the SRC functions, including training behavior, density of supernodes, adaptability, and whether pooling is hierarchical or global.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments evaluate the performance of various pooling operators against three criteria: preservation of node attribute information, preservation of topological structure, and information retention for downstream tasks. Different classes of pooling operators are tested on these criteria, and results show that while some meet certain criteria better than others, no single operator consistently outperforms all others across the board. The findings suggest that the choice of pooling operator should depend on specific task requirements and considerations of the problem at hand."
