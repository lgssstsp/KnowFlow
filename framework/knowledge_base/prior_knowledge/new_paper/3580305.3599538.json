    "paper_name": "Urban Region Representation Learning with OpenStreetMap Building Footprints",
    "method_name": "RegionDCL",
    "method_summary": "RegionDCL is an unsupervised framework designed to learn urban region representations using OpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints and points of interest (POIs). The method employs random points generated by Poisson Disk Sampling to address data-sparse areas and utilizes a triplet loss with an adaptive margin to preserve inter-region correlations. It incorporates group-level and region-level contrastive learning to adaptively manage varying region partitions, enabling effective representation learning that captures spatial distributions and similarity among buildings.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments conducted in two global cities, Singapore and New York City, demonstrate that RegionDCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different region partitions for tasks such as land use inference and population density estimation. The framework effectively handles data-sparse regions and adapts to multiple region partition schemes without requiring retraining."
