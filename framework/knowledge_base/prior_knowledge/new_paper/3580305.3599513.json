    "method_name": "ST-iFGSM",
    "method_summary": "The Spatial-Temporal iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (ST-iFGSM) is proposed to enhance the robustness of human mobility signature identification models against adversarial attacks. This method generates imperceptible adversarial trajectories with minimal edits on original GPS trajectory data. ST-iFGSM incorporates an iterative approach to continually refine perturbations while adhering to L0-norm constraints, which limits the number of modifications made to the original trajectory. This approach enables the generation of subtle yet effective attacks that can mislead HuMID models, thus improving their defenses through adversarial training.",
    "experiment_summary": "Extensive experiments conducted on real-world taxi trajectory data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ST-iFGSM algorithm. The results show that this method can successfully produce adversarial examples that deceive HuMID models. Additionally, after using ST-iFGSM-generated adversarial samples for training, the accuracy of the HuMID models improved significantly, increasing from 47.36% to 76.18% on testing samples. The experiments validated the efficiency of ST-iFGSM in generating powerful attacks while minimizing the extent of edits required."
