    "paper_name": "MM-DAG: Multi-task DAG Learning for Multi-modal Data - with Application for Traffic Congestion Analysis",
    "method_name": "MM-DAG",
    "method_summary": "MM-DAG is a multi-task learning framework designed for learning Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from multi-modal data, applicable particularly in complex systems like traffic congestion analysis. The methodology introduces a multi-modal regression approach to model the causal relationships among variables represented as scalars, vectors, and functions. A novel Causality Difference (CD) measure is developed to evaluate structural differences among DAGs while considering the uncertainty of causal orders. The method extends multi-task learning by jointly learning overlapping and distinct DAGs, ensuring consistency in causal relations across tasks.",
    "experiment_summary": "Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-DAG through synthetic data generation and real-world traffic congestion analysis. The results indicate superior performance over existing methods, highlighting the value of multi-modal design and the integration of causal relations among tasks. Key findings reveal that changes in Origin-Destination demand are critical for traffic congestion, and the learned DAGs reflect important causal relationships influencing traffic dynamics. The model shows improved F1 scores and reliable estimates of causal structures, emphasizing its practical applicability in intelligent transportation systems."
