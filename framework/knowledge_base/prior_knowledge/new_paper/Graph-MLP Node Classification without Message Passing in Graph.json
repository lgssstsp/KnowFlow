    "paper_name": "Graph-MLP: Node Classification without Message Passing in Graph",
    "method_name": "Graph-MLP",
    "method_summary": "Graph-MLP is a novel framework designed for node classification in graphs without utilizing explicit message passing modules. Instead of relying on traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which aggregate features through neighboring nodes using adjacency matrices, Graph-MLP employs a pure multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. The model consists of linear layers combined with activation functions, layer normalization, and dropout for regularization. To incorporate structural information from the graph indirectly, the framework introduces a Neighboring Contrastive (NContrast) loss, which encourages positive samples (connected nodes) to be closer and negative samples to be farther in the feature space. This approach allows for higher computational efficiency and robustness against corrupted adjacency information, enabling the model to still perform well even when the graph structure is incomplete.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experiments demonstrate that Graph-MLP achieves comparable or superior performance in node classification tasks when compared to state-of-the-art GNN models while being more efficient. The framework shows remarkable robustness during inference, maintaining consistent performance even when the adjacency information is corrupted or missing. Various hyperparameters were studied, indicating the framework's resilience to certain changes, with specific values enhancing performance in different datasets. A visualization of embeddings further supports the efficacy of the NContrast loss in maintaining class separation and embedding quality."
