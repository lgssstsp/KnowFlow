    "paper_name": "Fire: An Optimization Approach for Fast Interpretable Rule Extraction",
    "method_name": "Fast Interpretable Rule Extraction (Fire)",
    "method_summary": "Fire is an optimization-based framework designed to extract a sparse and interpretable collection of decision rules from tree ensembles. It utilizes a non-convex sparsity-inducing penalty and a fusion regularization penalty to encourage the selection of rules that share common antecedents. The framework aims to minimize a regularized loss function while allowing practitioners to evaluate the trade-off between model compactness and performance. A specialized optimization algorithm, leveraging block coordinate descent principles, is developed to efficiently solve the optimization problems posed by Fire, achieving significantly faster computation than existing solvers.",
    "experiment_summary": "The experimental results demonstrate that Fire extracts sparser rule sets that outperform state-of-the-art rule ensemble algorithms, achieving up to a 24% decrease in test error. Fire also provides rules that are more interpretable than those generated by existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in creating human-readable rule ensembles."
