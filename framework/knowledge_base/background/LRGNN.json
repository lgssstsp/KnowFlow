        "answer": "The article discusses the configuration of long-range dependencies in graph classification tasks using Long-Range Graph Neural Networks (LRGNNs). The primary focus is on the architectural design of the models, emphasizing two key design needs: sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes.\n\n1. **Sufficient Model Depth**: The article highlights the importance of deeper GNNs for capturing interactions from long-distant neighbors, essential for graph classification. The authors establish that stacking more aggregation operations allows GNNs to incorporate features from further nodes in the graph structure.\n\n2. **Adaptive Skip-Connections**: The design of skip-connections is emphasized as critical for mixing information across different ranges of neighbors. Adaptive skip-connection schemes are proposed to enhance the ability of stacked GNNs to utilize this information effectively.\n\n3. **Inter-layer Connections**: A novel framework is introduced for designing inter-layer connections in GNNs. This framework leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to adaptively determine the connections based on the specific graph data being processed.\n\n4. **Architectural Variants**: The article presents various GNN variants, such as LRGNN-Full, LRGNN-Repeat, and LRGNN-Diverse, each employing different combinations of aggregation operations and layer connections designed through the NAS process.\n\n5. **Empirical Justification**: While the experimental details are excluded, the authors assert that their proposed method, LRGNN, achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively designing the inter-layer connections and addressing the architectural needs mentioned.\n\nIn summary, the article fundamentally advocates for the integration of deeper GNN architectures and adaptive mechanisms in modeling graph structures to accurately capture long-range dependencies, particularly in the context of graph classification tasks."
